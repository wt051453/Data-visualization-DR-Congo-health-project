### Objective: to analyze its assumption that water-born diseases are the predominant source of the health crisis first, and to recommend next steps for building a sustainable infrastructure.

### Dataset exploratory using Jupyter Notebook:

3. I found the dataset from the W.H.O. and it contains a lot of information regarding health matters in the country. First I selected the columns of data to create a dataframe and focused on the data that I want to analyze. For example, the infant mortality rate, adult mortality rate, mortality rate for 5-14 year old, and for under-five and for both genders. Transformed the data into formats I wanted. Because the amount of data for the different age groups are different. I selected only the period of time, from year 2000 to year 2016, that they all have in common to compare. From the animated plot, it shows the mortality rate between 2000 to 2016 for these age groups. The mortality rate decreased over time for all the groups. I have noticed that the adult group has the highest mortality rate, but it could be due to the fact that it has the widest range of populations (age 15 to age 60). I have also noticed that the infant and under-five groups have relatively high mortality rate and they are more likely to have disease as the major cause of death than the other groups. For example they are unlikely to have causes of death like violence, murders, crimes and suicide etc.

2. To analyze further, let’s look at the tableau visualizations. I would like to go from general to specific. For example, from the age standardized disease categories to age standardized specific diseases, to again age standardized disease numbers by gender to the specific age group with specific diseases. In the pie chart, communicable diseases caused more death than the noncommunicable diseases and injuries in the country. In the top 10 diseases, the diarrheal disease, TB, malaria, HIV are communicable diseases, and the other five from top 10 in orange are noncommunicable disease. Also, from the communicable disease group, the diarrheal disease, the top 1 cause of death in the country and the malaria disease, they are both water-born disease or water-related disease. In the disease mortality rate by genders, they are almost identical to each other with the diarrheal disease being the top 1 cause of death, the TB caused more death in males than in females, and malaria is within the top 10 diseases for both male and female. Now let’s move on to the distribution of causes of death among children under age of 5. Malaria has the highest % of death rate, followed by the lower respiratory infections, diarrheal disease, measles, other communicable diseases, etc. These major ones are all communicable diseases and again Malaria, the top 1 and diarrheal disease are water-born or water-related disease. Here is the animated plot to show the death rate for children under age of 5 or between 1 to 59 months old from 2000 to 2017. The overall trend was that the death rate decreased over time and malaria was mostly the top 1 cause of death.

### Conclusion

My conclusion is that communicable diseases, especially the water-born diseases are indeed the predominant source of the health crisis in the country and to prevent them, I recommend to improve the cleanliness of water, increase standards for sanitation and hygiene.
